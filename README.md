# Bengali Transliteration Model

This repository contains a Bengali transliteration model that converts **Banglish** (Romanized Bengali) to **Bengali** text. The model is built using the Hugging Face Transformers library and fine-tuned on a custom dataset of Bengali transliterations.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that can convert text written in the Roman alphabet (Banglish) back to the Bengali script. This can be useful for a wide variety of applications, including improving text input for Bengali language users and building tools that aid in language localization.

## Dataset

The model is fine-tuned on the **SKNahin/bengali-transliteration-data** dataset, which contains pairs of Banglish and Bengali text. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

### Dataset Structure:
- `bn`: Bengali text
- `rm`: Romanized Bengali (Banglish) text

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bengali-transliteration.git
cd bengali-transliteration
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run the following Python script:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will train the model using the provided dataset and save the trained model to the `./results` directory.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the **SacreBLEU** metric, which is used to measure the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to reference translations.

```python
import evaluate
metric = evaluate.load("sacrebleu")
```

## Training Arguments

The model training can be configured via the `training_args` parameter in the `train.py` script. For example:

- `output_dir`: Directory to save model checkpoints
- `evaluation_strategy`: Strategy for evaluating the model during training
- `per_device_train_batch_size`: Batch size for training
- `num_train_epochs`: Number of training epochs

## Model Architecture

The model uses the **mBART** architecture (`facebook/mbart-large-50`) from Hugging Face, which is suitable for multilingual tasks. The model is fine-tuned specifically for the Bengali transliteration task.
